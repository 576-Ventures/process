# Process Definition

## Five Criteria

1.  Solves a genuine problem that you have

2.  Idea should not be blatantly derivative

3.  SRP. Idea should be small, specific, and well defined enough that v1 of the solution can be built fairly easily.

4.  Focus should be on building the product, not trying to solve scaling issues, how to get vc $$, who the first hire is. Idea should not require any external scaffolding in the beginning.

5.  Is there a solution that exists that can solve my problem better than I can if not, why does a solution not already exist? (What are the barriers to having a working solution)?

## Questions

1.  In thirty years, what will the problem space look like? How could a piece of likely technology change

2.  What are areas of frustration in things that you use / interact with? Why is it currently done that way?

3.  Whats my biggest domain expertise?

4.  What processes / work flow do you do that other people might not know about. Could you turn it into a product.

5.  What verticals can current / upcoming technology impact, what are some low hanging fruits within that vertical that haven't been solved for yet?
